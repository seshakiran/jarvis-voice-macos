## 💡 Tips

1. **Speak clearly** - The AI needs clear audio
2. **Use quiet environment** - Reduce background noise
3. **Be specific** - "send text hello to terminal 1" works better than vague commands
4. **Open terminals first** - Make sure target terminals are running

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If it doesn't detect your voice:
- Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
- Run `python3 test_voice.py` to test microphone
- Speak closer to microphone

If text doesn't send:
- Make sure target terminal is open
- Check AppleScript permissions in System Preferences
